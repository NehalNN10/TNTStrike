Petrol and diesel prices both decrease, interesting to note is that the length
of the article is much longer when compared to articles that have a price
increase. The headline states 'Petrol, diesel fall to near rs250 after fresh cuts',
using an approximation to indicate the price instead of revealing the exact price
can be seen as negative as it goes away from being completely neutral as exists to 
grab attention.

Petrol price increases, the article has a negative tone as it uses phrases like 'record high', 'massive hike' etc.
it really tries to sell the fact that petrol prices have dramatically increased, it appears as the article is trying to
elevate the situation

Petrol prices increase, the article has a very negative tone, from the start it says 'a psychological barrier has been crossed' implying mental negativity,
the headline also uses the word smashed, which suggests something being destroyed, words like "highly inflationary" add to the overall negative
tone of the article.
