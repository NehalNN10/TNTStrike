Comments: Petrol and diesel prices both decrease, interesting to note is that the length of the article is much longer when compared to articles that have a price increase. The headline states 'Petrol, diesel fall to near rs250 after fresh cuts', using an approximation to indicate the price instead of revealing the exact price can be seen as negative as it goes away from being completely neutral as exists to grab attention.

Total price change: PKR
